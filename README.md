WHY WE CHOSE REST?

- Compared to gRPC and SOAP we are more familiar with REST which we worked with during our second semester.
- Rest is more flexible in that it supports a variety of data formats, rather than requiring XML. JSON is easier for us to read and write than XML.
- Rest APIâ€™s can also offer better performance than SOAP because they can cache information.
- SOAP messages utilize a lot of bandwidth. So, in case if there might be a problem of resources and bandwidth, REST is a better option. 
- The coding of REST APIs and services is far more seamless than SOAP. 



MODULES
- Flask [Requests, Jsonify]
- Flask_restful [Resource]
- uuid
- Flask_sqlalchemy

STRUCTURE
- We have seperated the 2 services [Authentication and master data services] into 2 files. We used Flask_sqlalchemy as our data source.
