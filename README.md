WHY WE CHOSE REST?

o	Compared to GRPC and SOAP we are more familiar with REST which we worked with during our second semester.

o	Rest is more flexible in that it supports a variety of data formats, rater than requiring XML. JSON is easier for us to read and write than XML.

o	Rest APIâ€™s can also offer better performance than SOAP and GRPC because they can cache information.

o	SOAP messages utilize a lot of bandwidth. So, if there is a crisis of resources and bandwidth then REST is better option. It works wonderfully even if network bandwidth is restrained. 

o	Operations that involve no adherence with the statelessness in transferring information from one request to another can be done with full accuracy with REST. 


o	Caching of requests is a key operation and needs to be accomplished with full accuracy. 

o	The coding of REST APIs and services is far more seamless than SOAP.
