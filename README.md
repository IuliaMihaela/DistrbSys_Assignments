WHY WE CHOSE REST?

- Compared to GRPC and SOAP we are more familiar with REST which we worked with during our second semester.
- Rest is more flexible in that it supports a variety of data formats, rater than requiring XML. JSON is easier for us to read and write than XML.
- Rest APIâ€™s can also offer better performance than SOAP and GRPC because they can cache information.
- SOAP messages utilize a lot of bandwidth. So, if there is a crisis of resources and bandwidth then REST is better option. It works wonderfully even if network bandwidth is restrained. 
- Operations that involve no adherence with the statelessness in transferring information from one request to another can be done with full accuracy with REST. 
- Caching of requests is a key operation and needs to be accomplished with full accuracy. 
- The coding of REST APIs and services is far more seamless than SOAP.
